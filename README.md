Shoutcast Recorder
==================

A streaming audio recorder.
---------------------------

Shoutcast Recorder is a command-line Ruby application that allows one to record
audio streamed from Shoutcast servers, based on a finite state machine. Using
metadata broadcast by the server, recorded audio is broken up into files
corresponding to individual tracks, allowing one to listen to broadcast music
when he lacks Internet connectivity. The user may specify the amount of audio
to be recorded either by duration or by cumulative file size.
